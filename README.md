# Sentimnet-Analysis
This project focuses on classifying movie reviews into different categories using natural language processing techniques. The goal is to develop a model that can predict the sentiment or category of a movie review based on its textual content.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from the NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) library. Specifically, we utilize the movie_reviews corpus, which contains a collection of movie reviews categorized as positive or negative.
